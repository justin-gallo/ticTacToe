# ticTacToe
A tic-tac-toe game to practice factory functions &amp; the module pattern. 

#### [Live Preview](https://justin-gallo.github.io/ticTacToe/)

### Things I Learned: 
- Worked out how to structure JavaScript code using the module pattern & factory functions. 
- Experienced *why* these patterns are useful (such as private variables & functions, and more readable code)
- Increased understanding of arrow functions. 
- Became more proficient with CSS transitions and states (such as :hover)

### Things to Change: 
- I'd like to better organize functions within my modules to prevent so many functions/variables being exposed globally. 
- Need to update CSS so that interface sizing is dependent on viewport height (so that the interface doesn't break with particularly short displays).
